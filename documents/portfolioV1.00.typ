= LO. 1 Conceptualize, design, and develop professional media products.
First thing I made was a poster design made using Gimp. The design doesn't look good but it's my first thing made that is media related. Bellow is a link to my porfolio page. \

\
Here is a wireframe of a webpage I made. The idea was that me, Dylan and Constanti would make wireframes for a webpage and this is what I came up with. \

Here is link to the figma for the full experience \

\
It's designed in figma and there are a lot of prototyping done. The bottom has the main feature which is the group photo. The group photo will be the five members of the group next to each other and when you hover with the mouse on top of one the image will move left and/or right and make space for another bigger picture of the hovered member to pop up with description of that member including contact information. \
\
In Concept & Inspiration workshop I did the assigment. It was to follow this: \
\
Inspiration search > Key concepts > Sketch it out > Apply basic design principles. \
\
The entire thing has to be a rough sketch that links: inspiration > concept > design.\
And what I did is the following bellow.\

The inspiration was the everyday life in the east-european countries. And the key words were "Everyday life" and I tried my best to sketch something that represented that. In life a person that is shown to smoke with their hands in the pokets is usually a person that is just taking a walk. No reason at all. Just walk to clear their head. It's something everyone does almost everyday and showing exactly those things (the cigarette and the hands in poket) helped the audience to guess my keywords. The moodboard showed everyday activy places like: gym, panel block, boxing gym, more panel blocks and a factory.
= LO. 2 Transferable production.
In our studio im in charge of the repository. I made a GitLab repository which by default has version control. I always use at least two branch strategy so all the times there is a back up of all the work done. After every work day I take all the created media and push it inside a side branch and after each week I merge. Inside the repository there is documents, prototypes and archive folders. Documents are for documents, prototypes are for prototypes and archive is to keep stuff that are no longer relevant to the project (stuff that are no longer worked on) to keep the working folders clean and organised. \

= Why?
Because having a safe back up means that no files will ever be lost. \
Because having good versioning means that locating files will be done easily. \
Because clean and tidy storage space is important for every project. \
\
In one of my tasks I made a very basic twitch integrated game. In order to implement it to your stream you have to do a bunch of tasks. Because of that I made a simple text file with instructions on how to implement the game. \
Here is repository for game.\

= LO. 3 Creative iterations.
First thing we started working as a team is the name of our studio. We asked ChatGPT for names and we choose "Patchwork" because it reperesents us best as people of different backgrounds and skills. And also the word "Patch" can be aslo used for ICT related things. It was Hanna who wrote the promp to GPT. \
The logo came from the name and because of that there are a lot of patches. \
\
Bellow is a version of the logo i designed on the whiteboard wita a marker. It was just a idea mainly focused on having the rectangle on the middle empty. \
#link("https://bxrisyvnev.github.io/portfolio/#projects?file=patchworklogowhiteboard")
#image("images/logoOnBoard.png", height: 15cm)
The idea wasn't ok since there was too much empty space. \
\
Below the top right corner of the image has the logo that Hanna designed but it had the issue that the font wasn't good enough. Our group's tone is that we are professional but can still be fun. Since the colors are already fun I designed the left two logos with more professional font (FreeSerif Regular). The top one is with regular text typing and the bottom one is with capital "K" on the word "worK" wich is there just because it looks good. \
The bottom right is there just becasue it looked a fitting based on visual judging. \

\
My portfolio is a website hosted on GitHub pages that uses mostly HTML and CSS and minimal JS. The whole design is done with CSS and the JS used is to make the page only a single page by switching elements (hiding uneeded flexboxes and unhiding the needed flexboxes). This is so the background animation is not disturbed becasue switching to a new page when pressing a button reloads the animation which doesn't look good. \
This is only the first iteration of the portfolio and it was inspired by the bellow webpage:
#link("https://eloybe-design.webflow.io/")
In there the gradient is following the cursor and I really liked it but that used a lot of JS and makes the page heavy. I want a ultra light page with minimal JS. Because of it I made the background gradient move on it's own and also added transparent image to make it a little bit more eye catching and I belive it worked.\
On the project tab I decided to use a file tree design because I want my portfolio to reflect my software personality and there is nothing more software than a file tree with the projects in it with .pdf to make it look legit. \
Most of the design desidions are done following Wouter's feedback to take inspirations from other software developers' portfolios and that it should reflect me as a software developer. \

= LO. 4 Professional standards.
For the group project I am the scrum master. We decided to use Scrum Agile because our client is not professional in any shape or form and introduces uncertainy (it took her 2 weeks to respond to out first email). Because of that we choose Agile becasue it's very good work framework for these unpredictable clients. The idea is to make a lot of stuff each sprint and display them to the client and deside from that what she likes and what she doesn't like and work from there. \
I decided that Jira is to be choosen for planning tool as Jira is designed for Agile Scrum and also a lot of big companies use it so it's a great learning experience as it will come handy in the future. My team protested for a while because they are used to using Trello. But since we are not kids we now use Jira. \
It took multiple sesions with Paul in order to figure out how to use that framework and I still think that improvements can be made. \
Below are screenshots of the Jira board I made and a link for it. \

While we were waiting for Deska we decided that the only thing we cand is research. The research topics We came up were: Research current audience, Research targeted audience, Research overall capabilities of Twitch integrated games, Research other already made games by Twitch srtreamers. The distribution of these topics was done on "who wants it" basis. Hanna took the technology capabilities, Constantin took targeted audience, Malou took the already made games and I took the leftover current audience research. Dylan was not in the discussion at that time so he went and splited the task with Melou. The tasks that I gave out were to do a applied research document using a research framework by choice on the give topics. \
A week passed and it became apparend that my team mostly doesn't know what a research framework is and some members went ahead and did something completely different from what the task was... Hanna did no technology research and went ahead and showed examples of games which was Melou's topic. Melou didn't use any framework but at leas got the topic right. I have no idea what Dylan did... These are stuff I have to imporove for myself in order to be a proficiant Scrum Master. \

My research was done using the DOT framework and came to a valid conclusion. Bellow is a link to my portfolio webpage that displays my research document. \

= LO. 5 Personal leadership.
My portfolio is made using typst. Typst is a powerful typesetting system that is designed for advanced typography, efficient document creatinon and is really fast. It's basically coding your documents with advantage that is more customisations. Reason is becasue I come from software background and in terms of designing documents I can present myself better with code. \

\
During the break I had the task to develop a simple twitch integrated game in order to properly research the technologies that will be used. Bellow is a clip of a test stream I did testing the game features. \

You can't see it but in the chat im typing !feed, !play and !heal and the tamagotchi responds by doing an action and it's stats increase. Bellow are link to portfolio and repository.
