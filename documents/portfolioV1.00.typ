= LO. 1 Conceptualize, design, and develop professional media products.
First thing I made was a poster design made using Gimp. The design doesn't look good but it's my first thing made that is media related.

\
Here is a wireframe of a webpage I made. The idea was that me, Dylan and Constanti would make wireframes for a webpage and this is what I came up with.

Here is link to the figma for the full experience \

\
It's designed in figma and there are a lot of prototyping done. The bottom has the main feature which is the group photo. The group photo will be the five members of the group next to each other and when you hover with the mouse on top of one the image will move left and/or right and make space for another bigger picture of the hovered member to pop up with description of that member including contact information.
= LO. 2 Transferable production.
In our studio im in charge of the repository. I made a GitLab repository which by default has version control. I always use at least two branch strategy so all the times there is a back up of all the work done. After every work day I take all the created media and push it inside a side branch and after each week I merge. Inside the repository there is documents, prototypes and archive folders. Documents are for documents, prototypes are for prototypes and archive is to keep stuff that are no longer relevant to the project (stuff that are no longer worked on) to keep the working folders clean and organised.

= Why?
Because having a safe back up means that no files will ever be lost. \
Because having good versioning means that locating files will be done easily. \
Because clean and tidy storage space is important for every project. \
= LO. 3 Creative iterations.
First thing we started working as a team is the name of our studio. We asked ChatGPT for names and we choose "Patchwork" because it reperesents us best as people of different backgrounds and skills. And also the word "Patch" can be aslo used for ICT related things. It was Hanna who wrote the promp to GPT. \
The logo came from the name and because of that there are a lot of patches. \
\
Bellow is a version of the logo i designed on the whiteboard wita a marker. It was just a idea mainly focused on having the rectangle on the middle empty. \
#image("images/logoOnBoard.png")
The idea wasn't ok since there was too much empty space. \
\
Below the top right corner of the image has the logo that Hanna designed but it had the issue that the font wasn't good enough. Our group's tone is that we are professional but can still be fun. Since the colors are already fun I designed the left two logos with more professional font (FreeSerif Regular). The top one is with regular text typing and the bottom one is with capital "K" on the word "worK" wich is there just because it looks good. \
The bottom right is there just becasue it looked a fitting based on visual judging. \

= LO. 4 Professional standards.
Bellow are multiple logos with fonts that I designed. In order to get valid feedback I asked my group and the teachers about feedback.
#image("images/logoGoodFonts.png")
The team desided that the bottom left one looked good but the teachers had conflicting opinions. Wouter liked the Serif font and Paul liked the original font. They liked (and didnt like) the big "K" because it was breaking a obvious typing rule. But we still had to take inspiration from other logos. \
= LO. 5 Personal leadership.
My portfolio is made using typst. Typst is a powerful typesetting system that is designed for advanced typography, efficient document creatinon and is really fast. It's basically coding your documents with advantage that is more customisations. Reason is becasue I come from software background and in terms of designing documents I can present myself better with code.
